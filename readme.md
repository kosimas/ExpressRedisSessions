# ExpressRedisSessions
Here is a simple example of a express application with serverside session usage.

## What do I need to run this?
* You need NPM and of course Nodejs
* You need a Redis server.
    * If your are running Debian or Ubuntu just run
    ```
    apt install redis-server
    ```
    * On windows, just download the installer from the offical redis page. [LINK](https://redis.io/download)
